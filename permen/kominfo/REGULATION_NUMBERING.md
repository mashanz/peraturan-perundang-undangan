# Indonesian Regulation Numbering System

## Numbering Pattern Analysis

### Regulation Sequence Gaps
Indonesian ministerial regulations do not always follow sequential numbering. Gaps in numbering occur due to:

1. **Administrative reasons** - Drafts withdrawn, merged, or delayed
2. **Strategic reservation** - Numbers reserved for priority regulations
3. **Legal review process** - Some drafts do not pass legal compliance
4. **Policy changes** - Regulations modified during development process
5. **Timing considerations** - Regulations delayed due to external factors

### Historical Gap Patterns

#### Gap Statistics by Year
- **2024:** 33% gap rate (6 missing from 18 allocated)

### Search Strategy
Focus on published regulations rather than missing numbers:
- Use impact-based classification (Critical/High/Medium)
- Search by legal basis and content relationships
- Cross-reference by implementation status
- Track by regulatory categories rather than numerical sequence
